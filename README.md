# Mouse Jitter by rSanich
The program creates mouse shaking.

There are also sliders with fields for values ​​that allow you to adjust:
Horizontal movement amplitude (1-25 pixels),
Vertical movement amplitude (1-25 pixels),
Mouse shaking speed (0.001-0.01 seconds).

After each restart of the program, the initial values ​​are set, it was very lazy to do with the settings config.

Libraries used: tkinter, ctypes, threading, time.
